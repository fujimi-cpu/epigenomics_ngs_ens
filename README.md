### i. Data and biological context

During development, genetic regulation establishes the identity of cells and their differentiation pathway. In particular through gene mastering. Through a game of activation and hinibition of different genes, the cells differentiate. One way of activating and repressing is the shaping of the chromatin state, a strategy known in particular in the development of plants. By studying the state of this chromatin we can compare the different epigenetic states of cells. A known technique is the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) techinque, which targets histones with antibodies, the analysis then allows to map the antibodies on the genome, we can also map transcript factors if we have the right antibodies. This technique is nevertheless specialized in antibodies. We could try to have the global epigenomic landscape of dna accessibility by taking into account the different folds and proteins interacting with the dna, this is the objective of the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with highthroughput sequencing (ATAC-seq).
We use here the famous Arabidopsis thaliana model for the study of root development. In particular we are interested in the root apical meristem (RAM) and the cells of the quiescent centre (QC).
